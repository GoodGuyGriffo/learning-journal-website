            <h2>My new Journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
            <p>
                After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've 
                made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo 
                Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.
            </p>

            <h4>How I stay commited to learning</h4>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours 
                learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new 
                techniques into existing projects.
                <br><br>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning 
                and most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h4>How I got started</h4>
            <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes 
                about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not 
                only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned 
                using my own words.
                <br><br>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning 
                summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
